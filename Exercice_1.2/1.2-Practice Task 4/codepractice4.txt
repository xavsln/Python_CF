Assume that you’ve run the following statements:

>>> str1 = 'hello, '
>>> str2 = 'how are you?'
>>> str3 = str1 + str2
To practice what you’ve learned, without using Python’s shell, work out on your own what the following statements would return:

str3[3:]
str3[-3:]
str3[2:9:3]
str3[::-2]
str3[2:8]


1. Make a note of your answers in a text document.

str3 = 'hello, how are you?'

a. str3[3:]
This command will return 'lo, how are you?'

b. str3[-3:]
This command will return 'ou?'

c. str3[2:9:3]
This command will return 'l,o'

d. str3[::-2]
This command will return '?o r o olh'

e. str3[2:8]
This command will return 'llo, h'
