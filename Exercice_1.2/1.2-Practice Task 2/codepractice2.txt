1. Enter the total world population listed above into a tuple called total_population

total_population = (6789088686, 6872767093, 6956823603, 7041194301, 7125828059, 7210581976, 7295290765, 7379797139, 7464022049, 7547858925, 7631091040, 7713468100, 7794798739)

2. Make the data more concise! Perform a slice on total_population such that only every third data point is considered (6789088686, 7041194301, etc.), and store the slice as sliced_total_population.

3. Also, find the maximum value insliced_total_population.
