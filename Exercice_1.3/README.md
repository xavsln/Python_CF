Exercise_1.3.py is a simple script that asks the user to enter some recipes. (name, cooking time, ingredients).

Depending on the recipes parameters (combination of cooking time and number of ingredients), it will evaluate the difficulty level (Easy, Difficult, etc...) of each recipe.

All these data will then be printed out.

Eventually, the program will gather all the ingredients accross the entered recipes. It will remove the duplicated ingredients, if any, and sort them in alphabetical order. The list will then be printed out to the user.
