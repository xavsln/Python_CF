# Python Task 4

recipe_input.py is a simple script that will first ask the user the name of a document that includes recipes and ingredients.

The script will then check if the corresponding binary file with recipes list and ingredients exists.

If yes, it will open it and extract the existing data (recipes and ingredients).

If not, it will send an error and create a new binary file to allow data to be stored.

Then, the script asks the user to enter some recipes. (name, cooking time, ingredients).

Depending on the recipes parameters (combination of cooking time and number of ingredients), it will evaluate the difficulty level (Easy, Difficult, etc...) of each recipe.

recipe_search.py is also a simple script. It will open the binary file created above and then show to the user the list of ingredients available from the recipes in the list.

The user will then have to select an ingredient and the script will then show the user the recipe(s) that includes the selected ingredient.
