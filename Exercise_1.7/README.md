# Python Task 7

recipe_app.py is a simple script that takes recipes, cooking time and ingredients.

Depending on the recipes parameters (combination of cooking time and number of ingredients), it will evaluate the difficulty level (Easy, Difficult, etc...) of each recipe.

recipe_app.py also includes a search function that allows to print out recipes that include searched ingredient(s).

Data is stored in a local database and the App interacts with the database using an object-relational mapper (SQLAlchemy).
